# Copilot Instructions

## Repository Snapshot
- Workspace currently holds a single zero-byte file named `interfaz` at the repo root; no folders, manifests, or source files are present.
- Because there is no executable code, build scripts, or dependency definitions, assume the repo is an incomplete export awaiting the real project payload.
- Before generating code, confirm whether `interfaz` was meant to be a directory (e.g., an unzipped project) or if more files still need to be added.

## How to Proceed
- Double-check for compressed archives or alternate branches that might contain the missing source; avoid inventing structure without confirmation from the maintainer.
- If instructions reference unavailable files, pause and request the maintainer to supply the actual project tree so architectural context can be documented accurately.
- Once real files arrive, re-run repository discovery (list directories, locate package manifests, search for README/AI-guidance files) before writing code.

## Communication Checklist
- Ask the maintainer which language/framework the project uses, how it is built, and whether any generated assets should be ignored once the real code is synced.
- Clarify expected development workflows (build/test commands, environment setup) because no clues exist in the current snapshot.
- Document the confirmed structure immediately after the project files appear so future AI agents can reference concrete guidance.
